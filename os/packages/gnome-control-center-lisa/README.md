# gnome-control-center-lisa — GNOME Settings with a native Lisa panel

Spec: PLAN §5.3 (Settings panel), §5.11, §8. Decision: **ADR-0012**.

Our own build of `gnome-control-center`, pinned to the image's GNOME
version (**50.3**), that adds a native **Intelligence** panel to the
Settings sidebar. gnome-control-center has no plugin API — panels are
compiled in — so a sidebar entry requires building the package ourselves.
This is a *thin, maintained patch*, not a source fork: everything is
stock upstream except the panel dir and two anchored edits.

## What the panel does (v1)

- **Local models** — reads `lisa models catalog --json` (§8 hardware-aware
  fit) and renders each model with a plain-words badge (*installed* /
  *runs on this machine* / *tight fit* / *too big — use a provider*) and a
  one-click **Get** (`lisa models get`) for pinned models that fit. Local
  inference never leaves the machine — nothing here is egress-marked.
- **Providers & privacy** — opens the `org.lisa.Settings` app for the full
  provider / key / Sign-in-with-Claude / offload-consent flow. v2 moves
  these native into the panel (same `org.lisa.Remote1` D-Bus calls).

The panel talks only to existing backends (`org.lisa.Remote1`, the `lisa`
CLI); no backend logic is duplicated.

## Files

- `PKGBUILD` — derived from Arch's `gnome-control-center` 50.3-1; the only
  delta is `source += panel/*` and the `prepare()` injection.
- `panel/cc-lisa-panel.{h,c}` — the panel (`CcPanel : AdwNavigationPage`,
  built programmatically — no `.ui`/gresource).
- `panel/meson.build` — per-panel build (mirrors upstream, minus
  blueprint/gresource, plus `json-glib`).
- `panel/gnome-lisa-panel.desktop.in` — id `lisa`, category
  `X-GNOME-SystemSettings` (System group), search keywords.

`prepare()` copies `panel/` → `panels/lisa/` and applies three anchored
edits (guarded — a GNOME bump that moves an anchor fails the build):
`panels/meson.build` gains `'lisa'`; `shell/cc-panel-loader.c` gains the
`extern` decl and a `PANEL_TYPE("lisa", …)` row. (The exact edits are
verified against upstream 50.3.)

## Build & verify (Linux / CI / container — not macOS)

```sh
# In an Arch environment (CI runner, or `podman run --rm -it archlinux`):
cd os/packages/gnome-control-center-lisa
makepkg -s                      # builds gnome-control-center + -keybindings
# smoke: the panel registered and the desktop file is present
pacman -Qlp gnome-control-center-*.pkg.tar.zst | grep gnome-lisa-panel.desktop
```

`makepkg`'s `check()` runs upstream's test suite under xvfb. A green build
is the gate before this package reaches an image (ADR-0012).

## Wire into the image (next step, not yet enabled)

The image still pulls **stock** `gnome-control-center`. To switch:

1. CI job builds this package and publishes it to the Lisa pacman repo
   (`os/repo-tools`), layered **above** `[extra]` so it wins the stock
   package by repo priority (same name+version).
2. No change needed in `os/mkosi/mkosi.conf` (`gnome-control-center` stays
   in `Packages`) once the Lisa repo is in the image's `pacman.conf`
   ahead of `[extra]`.
3. Track L (`os/layer`) installs it the same way.

Until that CI job exists, this package is built and verified standalone;
it does not yet ship in a release. See ADR-0012 → Consequences.

## Maintenance

Re-pin on a GNOME bump: set `pkgver`, refresh `b2sums`/tarball as Arch
does, rebuild. If a guard in `prepare()` trips, the `wellbeing` anchor
moved upstream — point the three edits at a current neighbour panel and
rebuild. The panel C tracks the `CcPanel`/libadwaita API; a green
`makepkg` is the check.
